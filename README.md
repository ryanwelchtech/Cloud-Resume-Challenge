### Stage 1 - Creating Front End

This section is about building the visual representation of resume using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (which gets more important at stage 2).

#### 1.1 HTML

The resume should be created using HTML. It does not have to be pretty or contain sublime styling, since the challenge is not about perfect styling and responsive web design.
